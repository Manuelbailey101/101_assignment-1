<h1>A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>I was originally born in <b> <mark>Virgina Beach</mark> </b> but i was raised pretty much all around the United States . I've been to <b> <mark>  Virgina, Georgia, Hawaii, Alabama, and California.</mark> </b> So far out of all those places my favorite place to live is Hawaii, Some of the reasons i enjoyed living in Hawaii was because of most definitely because of the weather , the views , and vibe of the whole island. I currently live in san diego and work at Planet Fitness <sup> (sadly) </sup> , its not the greatest job but its nice not having to do anything but just stand and check people in . In my free time when im not at work i like to watch movies, cook , and play video games .

    <h2>MY PASSION</h2>
    <p>thats just a little bit about me , i wanted to get into coding because not only is my uncle an <b> IT </b> my dad is also an <b> IT </b> and he's influenced my decision on taking <ins><i>software Development</i> </ins>.I've also found a <b>PASSION</b> for helping ,<mark>Special Needs Kids</mark>, so im hoping this could maybe open another door to that. I've found a passion for helping Special Needs Children by <b> <mark>just being around them and watching them enjoy life </mark> </b> , seeing them grow as people is one of the most beautiful things i've ever witnessed and i believe that every person should have a chance to experience this .  </p>
